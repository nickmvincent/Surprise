'''
The :mod:`model_selection.split<surprise.model_selection.split>` module
contains various cross-validation iterators. Design and tools are inspired from
the mighty scikit learn.

The available iterators are:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    KFold
    RepeatedKFold
    ShuffleSplit
    LeaveOneOut
    PredefinedKFold

This module also contains a function for splitting datasets into trainset and
testset:

    Each fold is used once as a testset while the k - 1 remaining folds are

    See an example in the :ref:`User Guide <use_cross_validation_iterators>`.

    Args:
        n_splits(int): The number of folds.
        random_state(int, RandomState instance from numpy, or ``None``):
            Determines the RNG that will be used for determining the folds. If
            int, ``random_state`` will be used as a seed for a new RNG. This is
            useful to get the same splits over multiple calls to ``split()``.
            If RandomState instance, this same instance is used as RNG. If
            ``None``, the current RNG from numpy is used. ``random_state`` is
            only used if ``shuffle`` is ``True``.  Default is ``None``.
        shuffle(bool): Whether to shuffle the ratings in the ``data`` parameter
            of the ``split()`` method. Shuffling is not done in-place. Default
            is ``True``.

    '''A basic cross-validation iterator with random trainsets and testsets.

    Contrary to other cross-validation strategies, random splits do not
    guarantee that all folds will be different, although this is still very
    likely for sizeable datasets.

    See an example in the :ref:`User Guide <use_cross_validation_iterators>`.

    Args:
        n_splits(int): The number of folds.
        test_size(float or int ``None``): If float, it represents the
            proportion of ratings to include in the testset. If int,
            represents the absolute number of ratings in the testset. If
            ``None``, the value is set to the complement of the trainset size.
            Default is ``.2``.
        train_size(float or int or ``None``): If float, it represents the
            proportion of ratings to include in the trainset. If int,
            represents the absolute number of ratings in the trainset. If
            ``None``, the value is set to the complement of the testset size.
            Default is ``None``.
        random_state(int, RandomState instance from numpy, or ``None``):
            Determines the RNG that will be used for determining the folds. If
            int, ``random_state`` will be used as a seed for a new RNG. This is
            useful to get the same splits over multiple calls to ``split()``.
            If RandomState instance, this same instance is used as RNG. If
            ``None``, the current RNG from numpy is used. ``random_state`` is
            only used if ``shuffle`` is ``True``.  Default is ``None``.
        shuffle(bool): Whether to shuffle the ratings in the ``data`` parameter
            of the ``split()`` method. Shuffling is not done in-place. Setting
            this to `False` defeats the purpose of this iterator, but it's
            useful for the implementation of :func:`train_test_split`. Default
            is ``True``.
